/**
 * A lecture is a kind of lecture that is given to an attendance by a
 * speaker. This is the root document from which one can retrieve polls
 * resources, listeners list and moods. A lecture is defined by the
 * following properties:
 *
 * - id. An automatic identifier is assigned to the lecture by MongoDB.
 * A user (speaker) interacts with the API lecture endpoint by means of
 * the lecture id.
 *
 * - key. A lecture key is used by a user (speaker) in order to allow
 * other users (listeners) to join his lecture. This key is generated
 * on server side and should be unique in order for a user (listener)
 * to identify a lecture, not by its assigned identifier.
 *
 * - name. A lecture is titled by a mandatory name.
 *
 * - description. A lecture is describe by a mandatory description.
 *
 * - creationDate: A lecture is characterized by a creation date. It may
 * seem strange to store such a data given that a lecture is supposed
 * to be temporary. This date is used as a reference for moods statistics.
 *
 * - isPrivate. The web applications is provided with two types of lectures
 * which are public ones and private ones. The type of a given lecture is
 * defined by a boolean flag indicating whether it is public (false) or
 * private (true). A lecture is by default considered to be public in case
 * of a user (speaker) having not specified its type.
 *
 * - speaker. A lecture belongs to a user (speaker). This field basically
 * consists of referencing the parent user. Mechanisms of DELETE ON CASCADE
 * and UPDATE ON CASCADE should be implemented in order to ensure database
 * consistency.
 *
 * - listeners. A lecture is hold by a user (speaker) to other users (listeners).
 * these listeners are stored by means of an array of references. Mechanisms
 * of DELETE ON CASCADE and UPDATE ON CASCADE should be implemented in order
 * to ensure database consistency.
 *
 * - moods. It is expected from listeners to give a feedback about their
 * mood throughout the speaker lecture. This feedback is gathered in an array.
 * That's the purpose of the moods field.
 *
 * - polls. Any questions poll belongs to only one lecture. This is done by means
 * of an array of poll references. Mechanisms of DELETE ON CASCADE and UPDATE ON
 * CASCADE should be implemented in order to ensure database consistency.
 *
 * - resources. A user (speaker) may share resources with the audience (listeners).
 * It can be URLs, files, etc. These kind of resources belong therefore to a
 * lecture. They are stored by means in a references array.
