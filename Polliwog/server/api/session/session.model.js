/**
 * A session is defined by the following properties:
 *
 * - id. An automatic identifier is assigned to the session by MongoDB.
 * A user (speaker) interacts with the API session endpoint by means of
 * the session id.
 *
 * - key. A session key is used by a user (speaker) in order to allow 
 * other users (listeners) to join his lecture. This key is generated 
 * on server side and should be unique in order for a user (listener)
 * to identify a session, not by its assigned identifier.
 *
 * - name. A session is titled by a mandatory name.
 *
 * - description. A session is describe by a mandatory description.
 *
 * - isPrivate. The web applications provides with two types of sessions 
 * which are public ones and private ones. The type of a given session is
 * defined by a boolean flag indicating whether it is public (false) or 
 * private (true). A session is by default considered to be public in case
 * of a user (speaker) having not specified its type.
 *
 * - speaker. A session belongs to a user (speaker). This field basically
 * consists of referencing the parent user. Mechanisms of DELETE ON CASCADE
 * and UPDATE ON CASCADE should be implemented in order to ensure database
 * consistency.
 *
 * - listeners. A session is hold by a user (speaker) to other users (listeners).
 * these listeners are stored by means of an array of references. Mechanisms 
 * of DELETE ON CASCADE and UPDATE ON CASCADE should be implemented in order   
 * to ensure database consistency.
 *
 * - moods. It is expected from listeners to give a feedback about their 
 * mood throughout the speaker session. This feedback is gathered in an array. 
 * That's the purpose of the moods field.
 *
 * - polls. Any questions poll belongs to only one session. This is done by means
 * of an array of poll references. Mechanisms of DELETE ON CASCADE and UPDATE ON 
 * CASCADE should be implemented in order to ensure database consistency. 
 *
 * - resources. A user (speaker) may share resources with the audience (listeners).
 * It can be URLs, files et al. These kind of resources belong therefore to a
 * session. They are stored by means of an array of references.
