## <a name="Intro"></a> Introduction

The purpose of this report is to describe what has been implemented during the second phase of the project.

## <a name="Spec"></a> Specifications

First, a short summary of the features we had planned to implement for part 2:

* User accounts (optional for listeners, required for speakers)
* Lectures, allowing for the sharing of resources, creating polls, and viewing the current mood of the audience
	* They can be public and only require a key to join
	* Or they can be private and require an account and an invitation
* Polls, consisting of one or more multiple-choice questions
	* Users can answer polls while they are active
	* Poll results can be displayed at the speaker's discretion
* Mood, a measure of the overall satisfaction of the audience

From the [original specifications](https://github.com/paulnta/Teaching-HEIGVD-TWEB-2015-Project/blob/master/specifications/specifications.md), we dropped the TweetQuestions feature from part 2 with the intent to implement it in part 3 instead.

Client-wise, we wanted an interface that was clean and simple to use, and that included at least the following functionalities:

* Logging in to an account as a speaker, and:
	* Creating, editing and deleting lectures, and setting them as active or non
	* Creating, editing and deleting polls (and by extension, questions and choices), setting them as active or non, and viewing their results
	* Accessing the audience's current mood, as a graph
	* Creating and deleting resources to share
* Accessing the site as a listener, with or without an account, and:
	* Accessing a lecture, both via key and invitation
	* Accessing the current lecture's resources
	* Responding to polls when available
	* Inputting a current mood

## <a name="Tools"></a> Tools

* [Angular Fullstack](https://github.com/angular-fullstack/generator-angular-fullstack), for project scaffolding.
* [Angular Material](https://material.angularjs.org), as material design.
* [RAML 8.0](http://raml.org/), for REST API documentation.

#### Authentication

Every endpoint access requires that the user is authenticated. The authentication system of the application is working. The Angular Fullstack generator provides it by default during any project scaffolding. Therefore it was decided to use it directly instead of reinventing the wheel. A such decision implied to study the way it works which took some time.

Angular Fullstack uses the [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) authentication middleware for Node.js. Any user authentication is made via a username and a password. The authentication is ensured by checking whether the user request defines the HTTP Authorization field. If it is the case, the request is authorized and therefore forwarded to the appropriate middlewares. Otherwise, Passport will generate a token and store it in the Authorization field. Of course, it the user did not log in before, resource access will be forbidden.

Every time that the server controls whether a user submitting a request is authenticated or not, the previously described procedure will be applied. Besides, the document related to the user will be retrieved from the database and attached to the request. This greatly facilitates the API implementation. Retrieving any user will be done only one time and at only one location.

#### Routing

Since our REST API access points can reach several levels deep, such as `/api/lectures/lecture_id/polls/poll_id/questions/question_id/choices`, we decided that instead of obtaining all the IDs from the request manually at every end-point, we would make use of express.js's `app.param` method.

`app.param` enables us to trigger a callback whenever the given parameter name is found in the route. We use this to store the lecture, poll, or question ID directly in the body of the request before it's processed as it normally would.

This can be seen in the server's [route.js file](https://github.com/paulnta/Teaching-HEIGVD-TWEB-2015-Project/blob/master/Polliwog/server/routes.js).

#### Endpoints

The REST API was fully implemented according to the current version of the data model. CRUD operations can be performed on each available endpoint. It was decided to make available for each entity all CRUD operations. Some of them may be removed if it turns out that the client side of the application does not need them.

#### UPDATE ON CASCADE & DELETE ON CASCADE

Mechanisms of UPDATE ON CASCADE and DELETE ON CASCADE were developped in order to ensure and maintain database consistency. As a reminder, references through IDs are used to establish relations between entities. Deleting or updating a document should also delete or update another document subject to this kind of interdependence. This was done with Mongoose middlewares: similar functions to traditional SQL triggers were defined on *save* and *remove* events for that purpose.

#### Testing

The REST API was not subject to any kind of testing phase. One can not affirm whether it is working or not and whether there are issues or not. Anyway, its implementation was relalized by following the same logic as with the proposed version of the project first part. It should be fully working. That said, minor errors could be encountered while testing the REST API.

### <a name="APIDOC"></a> REST API Documentation

The REST API was documented while it was being both designed and implemented. A dedicated tool was used for that purpose. It was decided to use the RESTful API Modeling Language (RAML) as with the first part of the project. It is useless to enumerate all its advantages except maybe one: RAML makes it very easy to fully describe resources in a generic and concise way.

The current version of the REST API Documentation is well furnished. Every endpoint has been fully documented except the moods one due to time constraints. Anyway, it is provided with various examples of use for both requests and responses. Entity schemas have also been made available. This allows one to know exactly which data type is expected for a specfic property of a payload. 

HTTP status codes likely to be returned by the server are enumerated when necessary. These codes have been chosen according to the HTTP specification. For example, when a POST request is performed in order to create a resource, it is expected from the server to return the 201 HTTP status code, meaning that the resource has been successfully created.

While RAML was used to document the REST API, some additional tools were exploited in order to generate said documentation. Two versions of the REST API documentation have been generated:

* an HTML version for the Web application.
* a Markdown version for the project repository. 

This documentation generation was made possible by the following generators:

* [raml2html](https://github.com/raml2html/raml2html), a RAML to HTML documentation generator.
* [raml2md](https://github.com/raml2html/raml2md), a RAML to Markdown documentation generator.

The REST API documentation is not finished yet. It was planned to provide the documentation with general information about the API and the Web application. The purpose of that was to make users aware of both key concepts and key mechanisms related to the application. For example, one of the feature of the platform is to ensure privacy for a lecture, meaning that it is available only to some authorized users. The goal of having such information available in the API documentation would be to remind users of this interesting feature and to describe it in more detail.

>The REST API documentation is not available on the web application yet. It was not integrated on the client side because of time constaints. However, a local version can still be downloaded [here](https://github.com/paulnta/Teaching-HEIGVD-TWEB-2015-Project/tree/master/api).

## <a name="Work"></a> Remaining Work

The tasks we still need to complete to reach the goal we'd set ourselves are as follows:

* Finish coding the Angular.js controllers and services for our main features
* Finish linking the client UI (speaker side) to the server API so that it displays "real" values
* Test both the speaker UI and the CRUD operations on the API endpoints to ensure they are functioning correctly
* Implement the audience UI

## <a name="Issues"></a> Known Issues

The main known issue is that we did not manage to finish the work we'd planned to do in time, and thus that some of our features do not work. Some other features were theoretically finished, but we did not have time to test them, so we do not yet know if they contain issues that will require fixing, or if everything is fine.

The biggest "issue" so far is that the speaker-side client UI and the server API have not been completely linked yet, but this should be fixed shortly. We had more trouble than expected trying to code the Angular.js services using `$resource`.
