## <a name="Testing"></a> Testing and validation

The second phase of the project was subject to integration problems between the client part and the server part. This last part begun with an initial testing and validation step in order to test and validate what was done previously. 

### <a name="Strategy"></a> Test strategy

The approach used to test and validate the integration of the server part with the client part of the system was done by following these steps:

1. Database population with test data.
1. Assertion testing on API resources.

### <a name="Tools"></a> Tools

* [API Copilot](https://github.com/AlphaHydrae/api-copilot), for database population.
* [Supertest](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest), for assertion testing.
* [Should.js](https://github.com/shouldjs/should.js) for assertion testing.

### <a name="Procedures"></a> Procedures

#### Scenarios

##### Scenario: Init  

The goal of this scenario is to generate a huge volume of data. These data mainly consist of lectures, questions and choices. This is used to verify whether or not POST actions sucessfully create data.

File: [Init.scenario.js](https://github.com/paulnta/Polliwog/blob/master/Polliwog/server/api/Init.scenario.js)

##### Scenario: Remove

The goal of this scenario is to generate a few data which then are subject to DELETE HTTP requests. This is used to verify whether or not it is possible to a remove a particular data.

File: [Remove.scenario.js](https://github.com/paulnta/Polliwog/blob/master/Polliwog/server/api/Remove.scenario.js)

##### Scenario: RemoveAll

The goal of this scenario is to submit DELETE HTTP requests in order to delete every data related to any resource of the REST API. This is used to verify whether or not DELETE actions sucessfully delete data.

File: [RemoveAll.scenario.js](https://github.com/paulnta/Polliwog/blob/master/Polliwog/server/api/RemoveAll.scenario.js)

#### Assertion Testing

##### Lecture

The goal of this assertion testing is to verify whether or not a slug is added to a lecture when it is created and updated when it is modified.

File: [lecture.model.spec.js](https://github.com/paulnta/Polliwog/blob/master/Polliwog/server/api/lecture/lecture.model.spec.js)

##### Poll

The goal of this assertion testing is to verify whether or not a poll is added to a lecture when it is created.

File: [poll.model.spec.js](https://github.com/paulnta/Polliwog/blob/master/Polliwog/server/api/poll/poll.model.spec.js)

##### Question

The goal of this assertion testing is to verifiy whether or not it is possible to create questions.

File: [question.model.spec.js](https://github.com/paulnta/Polliwog/blob/master/Polliwog/server/api/question/question.model.spec.js)

##### Choice

The goal of this assertion testing is to verifiy whether or not choices are added, updated or deleted when the same events occur on related questions.

File: [choice.model.spec.js](https://github.com/paulnta/Polliwog/blob/master/Polliwog/server/api/choice/choice.model.spec.js)
